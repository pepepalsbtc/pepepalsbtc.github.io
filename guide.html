     <h2>Getting a PEPEPALS Minting Token</h2>
     <p>1) First you need a wallet that supports BTC NFTs; we suggest Free Wallet (<a href="https://freewallet.io" target="_blank">https://freewallet.io</a>).<br>
        2) Once you have your wallet and funded it with BTC, you can head to our Dispenser to purchase a PEPEPALS token. Go to: <a href="https://xchain.io/address/1PepepaLSbbFhFtSAGgj5Uh4FtTohpwZ7S" target="_blank">https://xchain.io/address/1PepepaLSbbFhFtSAGgj5Uh4FtTohpwZ7S</a> , click dispensers to see the appropriate amount of BTC (~$500) to send to our address to receive a "PEPEPALS" token, and once confirmed you will receive the PEPEPALS token plus any promo cards we have included.</p><br><br>
     <h2>Designing Your Card</h2>
     <p>1) Come up with a fun/cool/unique/etc design that fits into a few of our parameters and you will be off to a great start! Some broad ideas include a Pepe-version of some other animal/character, any animal/character that could be considered a "Pal" of Pepe, or just good quality artwork that you think would fit in with our overall project.<br>
        2) Choose a provided template from our "Templates" page to build around or even request some tweaks for your own custom version of an existing template. Overall card dimensions are 750x1050 pixels in a vertical orientation with 60 pixel radius corners. The following image will show the art size dimensions for various existing templates.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Minting Your Card</h2>
        <p>1) Mint your own token on the Counterparty blockchain, you will need some XCP (typically 0.5 XCP) to do this.<br>
           2) Your token must be locked and you must have 100% supply until the process is finished.<br>
           3) Your asset must be non-divisible.<br>
           4) Issuance must be between 1 and 10,000.<br>
           5) Submit 1 PEPEPALS token to <a href="https://xchain.io/address/1PepepaLSbbFhFtSAGgj5Uh4FtTohpwZ7S" target="_blank">1PepepaLSbbFhFtSAGgj5Uh4FtTohpwZ7S</a><br>
           6) Your new Asset Token's Issuer/Owner address must match the BTC Address that sent the PEPEPALS token, if not we may ask you to change the Owner of the new asset to the address that sent the token.<br>
           7) Submit the following: a link to your artwork (or attach it to the email), your PepePals Token Submission TX ID, your new token link, and let us know if you are interested in purchasing your token back for ~$250 in BTC (half of the original cost [offer good for 72 hours]) to use again in the future... to <a href="mailto:PepePalsBTC@Gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PepePalsBTC@Gmail.com</a><br>
           8) Your submission will not be accepted without a PepePals Token Submission TX ID.<br>
           9) You can submit anything for review, but if the art is low quality or blatant copyright, we may ask you to resubmit something better.<br>
           10) Give us some time to review your submission and if approved, we will lastly ask for a 48x48 pixel image you want to use as your "Icon".<br>
           11) Finally you will receive a link to your unique JSON file to set as the description for your new token and allow it to officially be in our PalsDex and a part of PepePals!</p>
